Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and deploy it as one package.

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services.
